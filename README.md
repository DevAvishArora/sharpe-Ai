# Sharpe AI - Demo Project


Create a React.js web application using a popular template library like MaterialUI. Implement seamless navigation with React Router for Home, Transaction, and Data pages. The Transaction page features a form for wallet address and amount input with Ethereum address validation and amount range check. A bonus includes storing submitted data in Google Firestore. On the Data page, fetch posts from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts,' filter for user ID 1, and display the results in a table. Visualize the data with a pie chart indicating the proportion of posts by user ID 1. This project assesses your React Router, form validation, and API integration skills.
